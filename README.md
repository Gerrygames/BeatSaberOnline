# BeatSaberOnline `v1.0.1`

Requires launching BeatSaber through **Steam**. Will not work with OcculusStore version yet.

Requires **CustomUI** & **CustomAvatars**

_This mod heavily improves the online experience in Beat Saber._

***Features:***
- Much smoother online experience
- Launch songs through the **Party menu**, meaning you can use all your regular playlists/Song Browser options to find songs
- Apply all your favourite **Gameplay Modifiers** right from the party menu for your whole lobby to use.
- **VOICE CHAT** - Talk in game to your friends or in a public lobby 
- No more servers. Everything is done Peer to Peer, meaning you host a game for your friends or for the public through Steam directly.
- Join friends through Steam friend list. You can launch and join friend's games directly through Steam. You can also **invite friends** from in game. 
- Lobby privacy. Host **friend-only** or public lobbies for others to join. No need for passwords.
- You **only** download songs that someone queues up to play. No need to select a playlist before creating a lobby and forcing everyone to download all the songs before playing.

***Usage:*** 
- You will notice a "Multiplayer" button with all the other mod buttons, this is your main lobby. You will notice you can host a game from here, or join a friend's/public lobby.
- To select a song, go into the "Party" screen in the main menu when you are hosting a lobby. Simply find you song and click "Play with lobby" to start the song. You can also select your game modifiers from the regular panel on the right of this screen.
- To enable Voice Chat. Go into the Multiplayer menu when connected to a lobby and click "Enable Voice Chat". Push to talk is coming, not yet ready. 
- Changing your lobby privacy, user count can be done in the settings menu before you host your lobby.
